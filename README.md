# QuoteClock

Simple concept to parse a literary quote for a certain time of date. The idea was taken from https://www.instructables.com/id/Literary-Clock-Made-From-E-reader/ after it was posted to Reddit.

This project also serves as a testcase to play with the creation of an SPA in VisualStudio Code and .NET Core. Not very special, but a fun concept to play around with.
